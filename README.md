## Installation

1. Install Homebridge if you haven't already (see [homebridge.io](https://homebridge.io))
2. Install this plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install -g homebridge-tsvesync
   ```
3. Configure the plugin in your Homebridge `config.json`

## Configuration

Add the following to your Homebridge `config.json`:

```json
{
    "platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "TSVESyncPlatform",
            "name": "TSVESync",
            "username": "YOUR_VESYNC_EMAIL",
            "password": "YOUR_VESYNC_PASSWORD",
            "updateInterval": 30,
            "debug": false,
            "exclude": {
                "type": ["fan", "outlet"],
                "model": ["Core300S", "LV600S"],
                "name": ["Living Room Light"],
                "namePattern": ["Bedroom.*"],
                "id": ["cid123456"]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

* `platform` (required): Must be set to "TSVESyncPlatform"
* `name` (required): Can be anything, this is the name that will appear in your Homebridge log
* `username` (required): Your VeSync account email
* `password` (required): Your VeSync account password
* `updateInterval` (optional): How often to update device states in seconds (default: 300)
* `debug` (optional): Enable debug logging (default: false)

### Device Exclusions

You can exclude specific devices from being added to HomeKit using the `exclude` configuration. All exclusion options are optional and can be combined:

* `type`: Array of device types to exclude. Valid types are:
  * `fan` - All fan devices
  * `outlet` - All outlet devices
  * `switch` - All switch devices
  * `bulb` - All light bulb devices
  * `purifier` - All air purifier devices
  * `humidifier` - All humidifier devices

* `model`: Array of device models to exclude. Examples:
  * `Core300S` - Levoit Core 300S Air Purifier
  * `LV600S` - Levoit LV600S Humidifier
  * `ESL100` - Etekcity ESL100 Light Bulb

* `name`: Array of exact device names to exclude (case-sensitive)
  * Matches the name shown in the VeSync app
  * Must match exactly (including spaces and case)
  * Example: `["Living Room Light", "Bedroom Fan"]`

* `namePattern`: Array of regex patterns to match device names
  * Uses JavaScript regular expressions
  * Case-sensitive matching
  * Examples:
    * `"Bedroom.*"` - Excludes all devices with names starting with "Bedroom"
    * `".*Light"` - Excludes all devices with names ending in "Light"
    * `"(Kitchen|Living Room).*"` - Excludes all devices with names starting with "Kitchen" or "Living Room"

* `id`: Array of device IDs to exclude
  * Can use either the device's `cid` or `uuid`
  * Useful for excluding specific devices when you have multiple of the same model
  * You can find the ID in the VeSync app or Homebridge logs

Example configuration with all exclusion options:
```json
{
    "platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "TSVESyncPlatform",
            "name": "TSVESync",
            "username": "YOUR_VESYNC_EMAIL",
            "password": "YOUR_VESYNC_PASSWORD",
            "exclude": {
                "type": ["fan", "outlet"],
                "model": ["Core300S", "LV600S"],
                "name": ["Living Room Light", "Kitchen Outlet"],
                "namePattern": ["Bedroom.*", ".*Nightlight"],
                "id": ["cid123456", "cid789012"]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems, you can test your credentials and determine your authentication type using the included test script:

```bash
# Test your VeSync authentication
./scripts/vesync-auth-test.sh

# Or provide credentials directly
./scripts/vesync-auth-test.sh user@example.com password

# For detailed output
./scripts/vesync-auth-test.sh -v
```

The script will:
- Test both NEW and LEGACY authentication methods
- Detect your account's regional endpoint (US/EU)
- Provide clear recommendations for configuration
- Show any error codes with explanations

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your VeSync credentials are correct
   - Try logging into the VeSync app to confirm they work
   - Run the authentication test script to diagnose issues

2. **Devices Not Appearing**
   - Check the Homebridge logs for any error messages
   - Ensure your devices are properly set up in the VeSync app
   - Verify your devices are running the latest firmware

3. **Regional Issues (EU Users)**
   - The plugin automatically detects and uses the correct regional endpoint
   - EU accounts will automatically use `smartapi.vesync.eu`
   - US/CA/MX/JP accounts use `smartapi.vesync.com`

4. **API Rate Limiting**
   - The plugin includes automatic rate limiting
   - If you see quota errors, increase the `updateInterval` in your config
   - Premium accounts have higher quotas than free accounts
5. Check that your devices are online in the VeSync app
