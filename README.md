# homebridge-tsvesync

This is a Homebridge plugin that allows you to control your VeSync/Levoit/Etekcity devices through HomeKit. It provides native HomeKit integration for a wide range of VeSync-enabled devices.

## ðŸ†• Recent Updates

- **ESWD16 Toggle Parity (v1.3.12)**: HomeKit power buttons now drive the real dimmer toggle API and restore the previous brightness, keeping the slider and wall plate in sync.
- **ESWD16 Improvements (v1.3.11)**: Dimmer tiles now use the new tsvesync bypass API, restoring reliable on/off control and removing the phantom colour widget for this white-only switch.
- **ESL Bulb Reliability (v1.3.10)**: Updated to tsvesync 1.3.10 so ESL100/ESL100CW/ESL100MC track the latest payloads for brightness and colour adjustments.
- **International Account Support**: Full support for accounts worldwide! Australian, New Zealand, European, and Asian users can now authenticate successfully
- **Country Code Configuration**: New country code dropdown in Homebridge UI for easy international account setup
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Supports the new VeSync authentication flow (pyvesync PR #340) with automatic fallback to legacy authentication

  * `humidifier` - All humidifier devices

* `model`: Array of device models to exclude. Examples:
  * `Core300S` - Levoit Core 300S Air Purifier
  * `LV600S` - Levoit LV600S Humidifier
  * `ESL100` - Etekcity ESL100 Light Bulb

* `name`: Array of exact device names to exclude (case-sensitive)
  * Matches the name shown in the VeSync app
  * Must match exactly (including spaces and case)
  * Example: `["Living Room Light", "Bedroom Fan"]`

* `namePattern`: Array of regex patterns to match device names
  * Uses JavaScript regular expressions
  * Case-sensitive matching
  * Examples:
    * `"Bedroom.*"` - Excludes all devices with names starting with "Bedroom"

## International Account Support

### Important for Non-US Users

If your VeSync account was created outside the United States, you **must** configure your country code for authentication to work properly.

#### How to Configure Your Country Code

**Option 1: Using Homebridge UI (Recommended)**
1. Navigate to your Homebridge UI
2. Go to the TSVESync plugin settings
3. Click on the "Country Code" dropdown
4. Select your country from the list
5. Save and restart Homebridge

**Option 2: Manual Configuration**
Add the `countryCode` field to your config.json:

```json
{
    "platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "TSVESyncPlatform",
            "name": "TSVESync",
            "username": "YOUR_EMAIL",
            "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
            "countryCode": "AU"  // Replace with your country code
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Common Country Codes

**Americas (US endpoint):**
- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States: `US` (default)
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canada: `CA`
- ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ Mexico: `MX`

**Europe (EU endpoint):**
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom: `GB`
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany: `DE`
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France: `FR`
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy: `IT`
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain: `ES`
- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Netherlands: `NL`
- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª Sweden: `SE`
- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ Norway: `NO`
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° Denmark: `DK`
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® Finland: `FI`
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Poland: `PL`
- All other European countries

**Asia-Pacific (US endpoint):**
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia: `AU`
- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ New Zealand: `NZ`
- ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japan: `JP`
- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore: `SG`
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ China: `CN`
- ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· South Korea: `KR`

#### How It Works

1. **European accounts** are automatically routed to the EU endpoint (`smartapi.vesync.eu`)
2. **All other accounts** use the US endpoint (`smartapi.vesync.com`)
3. The country code must match where your VeSync account was created
4. If you see "country code mismatch" errors, you need to set your country code

#### Common Error Messages and Solutions

**"COUNTRY CODE MISMATCH DETECTED"**
- Solution: Set your country code in the plugin configuration

**"Both US and EU endpoints rejected your account"**
- Solution: You must specify your country code - the plugin cannot automatically detect it

**"Cross-region error"**
- Solution: Your account is trying to authenticate with the wrong regional endpoint. Set your country code.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems, you can test your credentials and determine your authentication type using the included test script:

```bash
# Test your VeSync authentication
./scripts/vesync-auth-test.sh

# Or provide credentials directly
./scripts/vesync-auth-test.sh user@example.com password

# For detailed output
./scripts/vesync-auth-test.sh -v
```

The script will:
- Test both NEW and LEGACY authentication methods
- Detect your account's regional endpoint (US/EU)
- Provide clear recommendations for configuration
- Show any error codes with explanations

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - **For international users**: Check if you need to set your country code (see [International Account Support](#international-account-support))
   - Verify your VeSync credentials are correct
   - Try logging into the VeSync app to confirm they work
   - Run the authentication test script to diagnose issues

2. **"Country Code Mismatch" or "Cross-Region Error"**
   - You need to configure your country code in the plugin settings
   - See the [International Account Support](#international-account-support) section above
   - The country code must match where your VeSync account was created

3. **Devices Not Appearing**
   - Check the Homebridge logs for any error messages
   - Ensure your devices are properly set up in the VeSync app
   - Verify your devices are running the latest firmware
   - For international users, ensure your country code is set correctly

4. **Regional Issues**
   - The plugin automatically routes to the correct endpoint based on your country code
   - EU accounts (with EU country codes) use `smartapi.vesync.eu`
   - All other accounts use `smartapi.vesync.com`
   - Australian/NZ users: Use your country code (AU/NZ) with the US endpoint

5. **API Rate Limiting**
   - The plugin includes automatic rate limiting
   - If you see quota errors, increase the `updateInterval` in your config
   - Premium accounts have higher quotas than free accounts

6. **General Tips**
   - Check that your devices are online in the VeSync app
   - Enable debug mode to see detailed API communication
   - Restart Homebridge after changing configuration
